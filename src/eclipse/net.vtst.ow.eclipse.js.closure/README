CONFIGURATION TAB

1. Manage paths properly whatever the operating system
2. Variables?

THREADING

Potential threads:
1. Project builder
2. Document listener
3. Resource listener (for deletion of projects)
4. Window and Part listener
5. The project nature
6. Caller of the compiler

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO

1. Hovers with types
2. Run compiler in background
3. /?\ How to manage compilation errors / ensure that the compiler is run only
   when there is no compilation error. [In particular, missing ;]
4. Report errors and warning from the compiler.
5. Catch exceptions from the compiler.  Example: top-level function(x) {};
6. See TODOs in ClosureCompletionProposalCollector

COMPLETION PROPOSALS

1. Investigate extensions
2. Clarify how to get the list of completion proposals => See below.
3. Clarify how to sort completion proposals => Implement IJavaCompletionProposal.

How to get the list of completion proposals.
1. In a synchronous way:
   * Get the current position
   * Get the prefix of the current position
   * Get the scope at the beginning at this prefix
   * Take all proposals that begin by this prefix.  If the prefix has no dot, look into global
     variables.  If the prefix has a dot, look into members.
2. In an asynchronous way:
   * Do the same
   * Check that the last compiled version is still valid, by checking that the text before the prefix
   is not changed
   => We need to keep a copy of what has been compiled.

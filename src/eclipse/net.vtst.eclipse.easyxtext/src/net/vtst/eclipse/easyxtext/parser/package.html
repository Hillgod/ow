 Extensions for parsers generated by Xtext/ANTLR.
 <p>This package provides two independent features:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A framework to customize the lexers generated by Xtext/ANTLR
   using Java regular expression. This framework is particularly useful
   for languages which require context-dependent lexing. See the class
   {@link net.vtst.eclipse.easyxtext.parser.EasyScanner}.</li>
  <li>A value converter which checks the absence of whitespaces.</li>
 </ul>

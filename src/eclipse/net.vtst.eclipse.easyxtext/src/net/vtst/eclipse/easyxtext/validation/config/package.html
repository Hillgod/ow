 Allows configuration of declarative validator by the users.
 <p>
  This package provides a powerful and easy to use framework for allowing the
  configuration of declarative validator by the users via a project property page.
  Thanks to this property page, the user can enable or disable checks.
  In order to use the framework, the plugin developer only has to add some
  (optional) annotations to its declarative programmer class.
